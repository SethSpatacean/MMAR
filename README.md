# UC Irvine X-Ray Imaging Laboratory - Statistical Analysis
Code within this repository will be related to performing statistical analysis of larger datasets. The specific focus of this code will be to analyze results from the patient studies. An emphasis will be placed on organization and reproducibility.
# Myocardial Mass at-Risk (MMAR)
At the UC Irvine X-Ray Imaging Laboratory, we have developed software to calculate the "myocardial mass at-risk" past a coronary artery disease lesion, using coronary CT angiography imaging. For example, after imaging a patient with coronary artery disease, the specific coronary lesions can be identified, and the myocardium that diseased section supplies can be determined using our software. A variation of this software has been validated in animal models already.
# Summary of Results
Patients with higher levels of MMAR were more likely to have experienced a myocardial infarction. Higher levels of MMAR can also be used as a precursor for the culprit lesion.
